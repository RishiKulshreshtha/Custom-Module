One of the great features of Drupal is the ability to control how and what people can access on your site!

Are you SURE? What if you want to define a single role to your users and that too without any confusion of multiple check boxes selection.

This module helps you to get the single role select option for your users instead of the multiple.

After you've successfully activated this module, you should get this single role select box instead of the old multiple role check-boxes.
